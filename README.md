# Excel-Dashboard---Employee-Attrition
Excel Dashboard Project

The scenario for this project is that I am working in the People Analytics department and Iâ€™ve been asked to create a dashboard in Excel to track key attrition numbers.  
The data I used came from Kaggle and then I modified it to fit my analysis, so all information shown is fictitious. 
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/employee-attrition/data
The skills used in this project include: data wrangling, data cleaning, data modeling, Power Query, and Power Pivot.
